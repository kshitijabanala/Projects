This study uses a quasi-experimental, unbalanced design using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Results from this study show significant main effects for autonomy relatedness (p â‰¤ 0.0001), competence (p < 0.001), and autonomy (p = 0.1036), on positive effects, although no significant interactions were found. 
These findings show that autonomy, relatedness, and competence independently contribute to positive affect and each factor supports well-being without depending on the presence of the others. 
The results help inform employers and organization to prioritize fostering these elements in the workplace for increased employee positive affect, which might potentially impact employee productivity, morale, and satisfaction. 
Limitations and future research directions were discussed.
