This project aims to integrate study abroad program data from Penn State University (PSU)
and Ohio State University (OSU) into a unified and queryable schema. By web scraping
public program tables, cleaning inconsistencies, and structuring the data into an SQLite
database, we developed a comprehensive database that enables efficient querying and
analysis. Queries demonstrated insights such as program distributions by region, college, and
location. This work highlights the power of data integration and the importance of
standardizing schema to support multi-source data analysis.
